                    <p>If you want to buy <a href="http://www.bbcloth.ca">cloth baby diapers in Winnipeg</a>, you have a few options.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="hasButton"><b>AMP Diapers </b>- 1650 St James St, Winnipeg MB<br><button id="button1">More</button></li>
                    <li id="amp">AMP Diapers are made in Winnipeg and are sold all over North America. They specialize in pocket style diapers, with the AMP diapers priced $20 per diaper and the Peachy brand pocket style cloth diapers at $28 each. They also carry the Bummis brand prefold diapers which are a more economical option.<a href="http://www.ampdiaperstore.com" target="_blank"> Website</a><br><button id="button1Less">Less</button></li>
                    <li class="hasButton"><b>Tiny Tree Hugger</b> - 600 St Annes Rd, Winnipeg MB<br><button id="button2">More</button></li>
                    <li id="treehugger">Tiny TreeHugger sells an assortment of eco-friendly baby products including cloth diapers. They carry the AMP brand all in two pocket style diapers, $20 each. They carry the Bummis prefolds and covers (same as the AMP store) and the AppleCheeks brand of pocket style all in one diapers $24 each.<a href="http://www.tinytreehugger.ca" target="_blank"> Website</a><br><button id="button2Less">Less</button> </li>
                    <li class="hasButton"><b>BB Cloth Diapers</b> - 800 Wolseley Ave, Winnipeg MB<br><button id="button3">More</button></li>
                    <li id="bb">BB Cloth Diapers are made in Winnipeg. They are an online store with special discounts for Winnipeggers as well as free diaper delievery or pick up options. BB cloth diapers are quite different from what is offered at AMP or Tiny Treehugger in that they are NOT pocket diapers nor prefolds. They are one size fits 6-40lbs, 100% cotton cloth diapers with velcro closures and detached covers. BB's are not sold individually and come in 36 diaper birth to potty kits for $399 which includes everything you'll need to diaper your baby from birth to potty (Winnipeg residents can use this code for $50 off, with the coupon this works out to less than $10 per diaper). The upside of having a detached cover is simpler washing instructions, shorter drying times and overall better cleanability. BB's are not as absorbent nor do they leave the baby feeling dry like a pocket style diaper, the advantage of this is earlier, easier potty training. The disadvantage, you really do need to change them when they pee.<br>Full disclosure: I own bbcloth.ca so obviously I think they are the best option. I designed them with the goal of making an easy to use, simple to wash, durable, affordable cloth diaper that would help parents potty train early.<a href="http://www.bbcloth.ca" target="_blank"> BB Cloth Diapers Canada Website</a><br><button id="button3Less">Less</button></li>

                    <p class="serviceIntro">Winnipeg does not currently have a diaper service and I do not forsee one in the near future. There have been a few attempts and they have either failed or have never even gotten off the ground.</p>

                        <p class="serviceContent">There are some successful diaper services in other Canadian cities but not in Winnipeg. While a diaper service seems like a great option because someone else is washing the diapers for you, most parents don't end up doing in for a few reasons: <br><b>1. Diaper services are pretty pricey at $22 per week (average)<br> 2. Washing diapers at home is actually very easy, IF you have a washer and dryer.</b></p>

                        <li>Buying cloth diapers online from a Canadian company. <br>A quick Google search will give you a bunch of online Canadian cloth diaper retailers.</li>
                        <li>Ordering cloth diapers from Walmart.ca <br>They carry mostly pocket style diapers and some covers, diapers prices are comparable to other online stores.</li>
                        <li>Babies R Us carry some pocket style diapers, I believe it is the BumGenius brand which will be about $25 each.</li>
                        <li>Ordering the cheap pocket diapers made in China. <br>If a pocket diaper is less than $15CAD than you can bet it's made in China.</li>
                        <li>Make your own cloth diapers. Look on Pinterest and Youtube for tutorials.</li>

                    <p class="trivia"> How much money do you think you can save by cloth diapering? <br> <span class="questions"><button id="q1">Answer</button></span></p>
                        <p id="a1">$2,000 - $3,000 per child!<br> How much you save depends on the type of diapers you buy, whether or not you use reusable wipes and how many diapers (more diapers means less frequent laundering, which means less costs associated with utilities)</p>
                    <p class="trivia"> How much waste do you think 1 disposable diaper wearing baby produces <br> <span class="questions"><button id="q2">Answer</button></span></p>
                        <p id="a2"> Approximately 3000lbs of solid toxic waste. Did you know that in Canada alone, 4 million disposable diapers are discared EVERY DAY! AND those diapers take an estimated 500 years to decompose.  </p>
                    <p class="trivia"> Do disposable diapers contain any chemicals/materials that parents should be concerned about?<br><span class="questions"><button id="q3">Answer</button></span></p>
                        <p id="a3">Yes. Trace amounts of dioxin, known cancer causing chemicals have been found in disposable diapers.</p>
                    <p class="trivia"> How much earlier do you think cloth diaper wearing babies potty train?<br><span class="questions"><button id="q4">Answer</button></span></p>
                    <p id="a4">On average 12 months earlier. The average age disposable babies are potty trained is 37 months. In contrast, it's not uncommon for babies diapered in cloth to be out of diapers by 18 months.</p>
                        <p class="trivia">Are cloth diapers a lot more work?<br><span class="questions"><button id="q5">Answer</button></span></p>
                        <p id="a5">Yes and no. Yes, they are more work <b>in the beginning.</b> The extra work comes from changing them more frequently than disposables because you actually change them when they pee not just every few hours or when they poop. Also you have to wash, dry and fold them, BUT as time goes on your baby goes through less diapers and this routine gets easier and easier. <br>No they are not more work in the long because they are out of diapers much earlier. </p>
                        <p class="trivia">Are you a good candidate for cloth diapering?<br><span class="questions"><button id="q6">Answer</button></span></p>
                        <p id="a6">Well, that depends on a few factors, lucky for you there's a free, no sign up 2 minute quiz, <a href="http://www.bbcloth.ca/take-the-test" target="_blank">click here to take the test now!</a></p>
